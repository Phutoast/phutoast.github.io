Nice to meet you. I'm Phu Sakulwongtana (ภูร์ สกุลวงศ์ธนา) from Thailand. I'm generally interested in machine learning and mathematics (especially category theory and its application).

This website contains what I have learnt over the year. I decided to split my contents to be in 3 types:

- [Technical Writing](writings.qmd): mainly about math (especially category theory) and machine learning
- [Collection of my larger works](works.qmd): including my <a href="https://phutoast.github.io/thai-translation-ctfp" target="_blank">WIP thai translation</a> of the book *Category theory for Programmers* by Bartosz Milewski, and other longer form writing.
- [Notes](miscellaneous.qmd) on subjects that I am quite new into, for example: philosophy and other related fields (might be abit of chemistry and neuroscience mixed in). These are mostly expository/summary notes from the book that I have read.
